        "message": "GPT: Internal linking is a crucial aspect of SEO for blog posts. Here are some key points regarding internal linking as highlighted in the expanded section:\n\n- **Internal linking is not only helpful for readers, but it also keeps people on your blog for longer** which can reduce bounce rate and increase time on site, both positive indicators to search engines.\n- It also **gives extra authority to your other content**, helping to spread page authority and ranking power among pages in your site.\n- When practicing internal linking, it is recommended to **link to at least one of your own articles or webpages in your blog**. This helps users easily navigate to other pages and keeps them engaged with more of your content.\n- For an effective internal linking strategy, it is best to follow a **reverse silo structure** or to simply put content into clusters. This means organizing your content so that you have a main 'pillar' page that acts as the authoritative source, and then linking to and from related 'cluster' content that supports and enhances that main topic.\n\nThese practices help search engines better understand the structure and hierarchy of your site, which can contribute to improved SEO performance.\n\nDo you need more information on this topic or help with other SEO strategies?"
